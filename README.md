![Task3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ee845cf-04e2-4b13-af0b-4a8dd1ba3d0a)
This repository contains **Task 3** of the Data Science Internship offered by **Prodigy Infotech**. The objective of this task was to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict customer behavior related to term deposits using a banking dataset.

## Objective
To develop a classification model using the **Decision Tree algorithm**. The model predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features in the dataset. The task also includes data preprocessing, feature selection, training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.
